## Party Delights code test

2 versions available

## Version 1

Uses a flat data structure

This works as expected as per job spec (see /docs folder)

Swap out script reference in slider.html to use script-flatdata.js

## Version 2

Uses the Json data structure

All works as expected although the loop isnt working.

It appears to be conflicting with the setTimeout function.

See comments in script.js
